Description:There is a bridge  with cars coming from two directions. The bridge allows maximum three cars to across it from same direction at same time. To balance two sides, after three cars acrossing the bridge, if there are cars waiting for the bridge on another side, these cars should have the higher priority. If there is no car waiting on another side, the following cars will have same priority.
